# How do I use this thing?
The default prefix is `.`, however you can easily change the prefix with `.prefix [new prefix]`. If you forget the prefix, just `@mention` RoboLiam and you'll get the server prefix. To see the commands, say `.help` or if you'd like, you can say `.cmds`! Many of RoboLiam's commands have aliases so you don't have to step out of your confort zone!
